p {
    color: #FF000
}
body {
    padding: 0
    margin: 0
}
Class Selectors: (think like method assignments in Python)
.has-blue-text {
    color: #FF0000
}
Id selectors: Id can only be specific to one html tab.
#main-navigation {
    background-color: orange
}
Specificity
ID = 1 (only possible to use on one element, and trumps everything)
Class = many (2nd highest specifity and trumps tag specificity, if multiple classes, renders in order of css file)
Tag = (standard applies to all instances of tag)
